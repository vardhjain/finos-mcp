## Purpose

**MCP Server Security Governance** establishes comprehensive security controls for Model Context Protocol servers including supply chain verification, secure communication channels, data integrity validation, and continuous monitoring. This preventive control ensures that MCP servers providing specialized capabilities to agentic AI systems maintain appropriate security standards and cannot be used as vectors for systematic compromise of agent decision-making.

This mitigation addresses the unique risks introduced by the distributed architecture of MCP-based agentic systems, where agents rely on external servers for critical data and capabilities, creating supply chain dependencies that require specialized security governance.

---

## Key Principles

Effective MCP server security governance requires comprehensive coverage of the entire MCP service lifecycle:

* **Supply Chain Verification**: Thorough vetting and continuous monitoring of MCP server providers, including security assessments and compliance verification.
* **Secure Communication**: Implementation of robust encryption, authentication, and integrity protection for all MCP protocol communications.
* **Data Integrity Assurance**: Validation mechanisms to ensure data provided by MCP servers is authentic, complete, and hasn't been tampered with.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of MCP server behavior, performance, and security indicators to detect compromise or degradation.
* **Service Isolation**: Proper isolation between different MCP servers and between MCP services and core agent systems to limit blast radius.
* **Incident Response Integration**: Comprehensive incident response procedures specific to MCP server compromise scenarios.

---

## Tiered Implementation Approach

Organizations should adopt MCP server security governance appropriate to their deployment model and risk tolerance. This mitigation presents three tiers of implementation, each building on the previous tier with increasing security controls and complexity:

### Tier 1: Centralized Proxy + Human-in-the-Loop Controls
**Recommended for:** Organizations beginning MCP adoption, coding assistant deployments, development workflows

* **Architecture**: All MCP clients connect through a centrally-administered MCP proxy server that enforces connections only to pre-approved, trusted MCP server implementations
* **Key Controls**:
  * Central IT/security team maintains allowlist of approved MCP servers
  * MCP proxy enforces connection restrictions (clients cannot bypass proxy to connect directly to MCP servers)
  * Approved MCP servers undergo basic security vetting including:
    * Source code review for open source implementations
    * Scanning of transitive dependencies and license checks
    * CVE checks and vulnerability scanning
    * Vendor assessment for commercial providers
  * TLS encryption for all MCP communications
  * **Human approval required before agents execute actions provided by MCP servers**
  * Regular security reviews of approved MCP servers (at least annually)
  * Incident response procedures specific to MCP server compromise
* **Example**: [GitHub Copilot's centralized MCP server access configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/configure-mcp-server-access)

### Tier 2: Centralized Proxy with Pre-Approved Servers
**Recommended for:** Production deployments with moderate risk, customer-facing applications with oversight

* **All Tier 1 controls, minus Human-in-the-Loop, plus**:
* **Additional Controls**:
  * Enhanced monitoring and alerting on MCP server behavior and data anomalies (replaces human approval)
  * User/agent identity propagation through MCP proxy for comprehensive audit trails
  * Basic logging of MCP server connections and usage patterns

### Tier 3: Distributed Many-to-Many with Comprehensive Security
**Recommended for:** Complex multi-agent systems, high-risk financial transactions, fully autonomous deployments

* **All Tier 1 and 2 controls, plus**:
* **Additional Controls**:
  * Comprehensive supply chain due diligence for all MCP server providers (detailed in sections below)
  * Advanced data integrity validation including cryptographic signatures and cross-reference validation
  * Real-time behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection for MCP server responses
  * Network segmentation and service isolation for MCP connections
  * Mutual authentication between all MCP clients and servers
  * Advanced incident response capabilities with forensic analysis and rapid isolation procedures

Organizations should start with Tier 1 controls and progress to higher tiers as their MCP deployment matures, risk profile increases, or autonomy levels grow. The detailed implementation guidance below provides comprehensive controls appropriate for Tier 3 deployments, with many controls also applicable to lower tiers.

## Challenges and Considerations

* **Tier Selection and Progression**: Organizations must carefully assess their risk profile, deployment maturity, and operational capabilities to select the appropriate tier. Moving between tiers requires significant planning and may impact existing deployments.
* **Centralized Proxy as Single Point of Failure**: Tier 1 and 2 implementations rely on a centralized MCP proxy, which becomes a critical system requiring high availability and robust security controls. Organizations must ensure the proxy itself doesn't become a vulnerability.
* **Third-Party Dependency Management**: Managing security across multiple third-party MCP server providers with varying security capabilities and standards, particularly challenging in Tier 3 distributed deployments.
* **Performance vs. Security Trade-offs**: Balancing comprehensive security validation with the performance requirements of real-time agent operations. Tier 3 controls may introduce latency that is unacceptable for some use cases.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring MCP server governance meets regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions and financial service regulations.
* **Incident Response Complexity**: Coordinating incident response across multiple MCP server providers and internal systems during security events, especially in Tier 3 deployments.
