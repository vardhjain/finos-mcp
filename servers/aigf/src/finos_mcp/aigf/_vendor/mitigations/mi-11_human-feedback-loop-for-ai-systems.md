## Purpose

A **Human Feedback Loop** is a critical detective and continuous improvement mechanism that involves systematically collecting, analyzing, and acting upon feedback provided by human users, subject matter experts (SMEs), or reviewers regarding an AI system's performance, outputs, or behavior. In the context of financial institutions, this feedback is invaluable for:
* **Monitoring AI System Efficacy:** Understanding how well the AI system is meeting its objectives in real-world scenarios.
* **Identifying Issues:** Detecting problems such as inaccuracies, biases, unexpected behaviors (`ri-5`, `ri-6`), security vulnerabilities (e.g., successful prompt injections, data leakage observed by users), usability challenges, or instances where the AI generates inappropriate or harmful content.
* **Enabling Continuous Improvement:** Providing data-driven insights to refine AI models, update underlying data (e.g., for RAG systems), tune prompts, and enhance user experience.
* **Supporting Incident Response:** Offering a channel for users to report critical failures or adverse impacts, which can trigger incident response processes.
* **Informing Governance:** Providing qualitative and quantitative data to AI governance bodies and ethics committees.

This control emphasizes the importance of structuring how human insights are captured and integrated into the AI system's lifecycle for ongoing refinement and risk management.

## Key Principles

To ensure a human feedback loop is valuable and effective, it should be designed around these core principles:

* **Clear Objectives & Actionability:** Feedback collection should be purposeful, with clearly defined goals for how the gathered information will be used to improve the AI system or mitigate risks. Feedback should be sufficiently detailed to be actionable.
* **Accessibility and User-Centric Design:** Mechanisms for providing feedback must be easily accessible, intuitive to use, and should not unduly disrupt the user's workflow or experience. (Aligns with ISO 42001 A.8.2)
* **Timeliness:** Processes for collecting, reviewing, and acting upon feedback should be timely to address critical issues promptly and ensure that improvements are relevant.
* **Alignment with Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Feedback mechanisms should be designed to help assess the AI system's performance against predefined KPIs and business objectives.
* **Contextual Information:** Encourage feedback that includes context about the situation in which the AI system's behavior was observed, as this is crucial for accurate interpretation and effective remediation.
* **Transparency with Users:** Where appropriate, inform users about how their feedback is valued, how it will be used, and potentially provide updates on actions taken. This encourages ongoing participation. (Aligns with ISO 42001 A.8.3, A.3.3)
* **Structured and Consistent Collection:** Employ consistent methods for collecting feedback to allow for trend analysis and aggregation of insights over time.

## Implementation Guidance

Implementing an effective human feedback loop involves careful design of the mechanism, clear processes for its use, and integration with broader AI governance.

### 1. Designing the Feedback Mechanism
* **Define Intended Use and KPIs:**
    * **Objectives:** Clearly document how feedback data will be utilized, such as for prompt fine-tuning, RAG document updates, model/data drift detection, or more advanced uses like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
    * **KPI Alignment:** Design feedback questions and metrics to align with the solution's key performance indicators (KPIs). For example, if accuracy is a KPI, feedback might involve users or SMEs annotating if an answer was correct. 
* **User Experience (UX) Considerations:**
    * **Ease of Use:** Ensure the feedback mechanism (e.g., buttons, forms, comment boxes) is simple, intuitive, and does not significantly hamper the user's primary task.
    * **Willingness to Participate:** Gauge the target audience's willingness to provide feedback; make it optional and low-effort where possible.
* **Determine Feedback Scope (Wide vs. Narrow):**
    * **Wide Feedback:** Collect feedback from the general user base. Suitable for broad insights and identifying common issues.
    * **Narrow Feedback:** For scenarios where general user feedback might be disruptive or if highly specialized input is needed, create a smaller, dedicated group of expert testers or SMEs. These SMEs can provide continuous, detailed feedback directly to development teams. 

### 2. Types of Feedback and Collection Methods
* **Quantitative Feedback:**
    * **Description:** Involves collecting structured responses that can be easily aggregated and measured, such as numerical ratings (e.g., "Rate this response on a scale of 1-5 for helpfulness"), categorical choices (e.g., "Was this answer: Correct/Incorrect/Partially Correct"), or binary responses (e.g., thumbs up/down).
    * **Use Cases:** Effective for tracking trends, measuring against KPIs, and quickly identifying areas of high or low performance.
* **Qualitative Feedback:**
    * **Description:** Consists of open-ended, free-form text responses where users can provide detailed comments, explanations, or describe nuanced issues not captured by quantitative metrics.
    * **Use Cases:** Offers rich insights into user reasoning, identifies novel problems, and provides specific examples of AI behavior. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques or even other LLMs can be employed to analyze and categorize this textual feedback at scale.
* **Implicit Feedback:**
    * **Description:** Derived indirectly from user actions rather than explicit submissions, e.g., whether a user accepts or ignores an AI suggestion, time spent on an AI-generated summary, or if a user immediately rephrases a query after an unsatisfactory response.
    * **Use Cases:** Can provide large-scale, less biased indicators of user satisfaction or task success.
* **Channels for Collection:**
    * In-application widgets (e.g., rating buttons, feedback forms).
    * Dedicated reporting channels or email addresses.
    * User surveys.
    * Facilitated feedback sessions with SMEs or user groups.
    * Mechanisms for users to report concerns about adverse impacts or ethical issues (aligns with ISO 42001 A.8.3, A.3.3).

### 3. Processing and Utilizing Feedback
* **Systematic Analysis:** Implement processes for regularly collecting, aggregating, and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative feedback.
* **Specific Use Cases for Feedback Data:**
    * **Prompt Engineering and Fine-tuning:** Use feedback on LLM responses to identify weaknesses in prompts and iteratively refine them to improve clarity, relevance, and safety.
    * **RAG System Improvement:** Examine low-rated responses from RAG systems to pinpoint deficiencies in the underlying knowledge base, signaling opportunities for content updates, corrections, or additions.
    * **Model and Data Drift Detection:** Track feedback metrics over time to quantitatively detect degradation in model performance or shifts in output quality that might indicate model drift (due to changes in the foundational model version - addresses `ri-11`) or data drift (due to changes in input data characteristics).
    * **Identifying Security Vulnerabilities:** User feedback can be an invaluable source for detecting instances where AI systems have been successfully manipulated (e.g., prompt injection), have leaked sensitive information, or exhibit other security flaws.
    * **Highlighting Ethical Concerns and Bias:** Provide a channel for users to report outputs they perceive as biased, unfair, inappropriate, or ethically problematic.
    * **Improving User Documentation and Training:** Feedback can highlight areas where user guidance or system documentation (as per ISO 42001 A.8.2) needs improvement.

### 4. Advanced Feedback Integration: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
* **Conceptual Overview for Risk Audience:** RLHF is an advanced machine learning technique where AI models, particularly LLMs, are further refined using direct human judgments on their outputs. Instead of solely relying on pre-existing data, human evaluators assess model responses (e.g., rating helpfulness, correctness, safety, adherence to instructions). This feedback is then used to systematically adjust the model's internal decision-making processes, effectively "rewarding" desired behaviors and "penalizing" undesired ones.
* **Key Objective:** The primary goal of RLHF is to better align the AI model's behavior with human goals, nuanced preferences, ethical considerations, and complex instructions that are hard to specify in traditional training datasets.
* **Process Simplification:**
    1.  **Feedback Collection:** Systematically gather human evaluations on model outputs for a diverse set of inputs.
    2.  **Reward Modeling:** This feedback is often used to train a separate "reward model" that learns to predict human preferences.
    3.  **Policy Optimization:** The primary AI model is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning techniques, with the reward model providing signals to guide its learning towards generating more highly-rated outputs.
* **Benefits for Control:** RLHF can significantly improve model safety, reduce the generation of harmful or biased content, and enhance the model's ability to follow instructions faithfully. 

### 5. Integration with "LLM-as-a-Judge" Concepts
* **Context:** As organizations explore using LLMs to evaluate the outputs of other LLMs ("LLM-as-a-Judge" - see [CT-15](./ct-15.md)), human feedback loops remain essential.
* **Application:** Implement mechanisms for humans (especially SMEs) to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback on the judgments made by these LLM judges.
* **Benefits:** This allows for:
    * Comparison of feedback quality and consistency between human SMEs and LLM judges.
    * Calibration and evaluation of the LLM-as-a-Judge system's effectiveness and reliability.
    * Targeted human review (narrow feedback) on a sample of LLM-as-a-Judge results, with sample size and methodology dependent on the use-case criticality.

### 6. Feedback Review, Actioning, and Governance Process
* **Defined Responsibilities:** Assign clear roles and responsibilities for collecting, reviewing, triaging, and actioning feedback (e.g., product owners, MLOps teams, data science teams, AI governance committees).
* **Triage and Prioritization:** Establish a process to categorize and prioritize incoming feedback based on severity, frequency, potential impact, and alignment with strategic goals.
* **Feedback Participation Monitoring:** Track submission rates and feedback quality over time as early indicators of feedback loop degradation. A sustained decline is often caused by feedback fatigue, when the effort required outweighs the perceived impact, and can make feedback statistically unrepresentative, weakening triage and governance decisions. If participation drops, corrective actions should be taken, such as simplifying feedback channels, rotating SME reviewers, or clearly communicating the impact of prior submissions.
* **Tracking and Resolution:** Implement a system to track feedback items, the actions taken in response, and their outcomes.
* **Closing the Loop:** Where appropriate and feasible, inform users or feedback providers about how their input has been used or what changes have been made, fostering a sense of engagement. (Supports ISO 42001 A.6.2.6 for repairs/updates based on feedback).
