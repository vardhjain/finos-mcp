## Summary

In multi-agent systems, compromised agents affect other agents through shared resources, communication channels, or state corruption, leading to systemic failures and cascading security incidents. Trust boundary violations allow compromise to propagate across agent networks, potentially affecting entire business processes and requiring comprehensive incident response across multiple agent systems.

## Description

**Multi-Agent Trust Boundary Violations** occur when security compromises in one agent system propagate to other agents within a multi-agent environment, violating the intended trust boundaries and isolation controls. This risk is particularly acute in financial services where different agents may handle different aspects of complex business processes, requiring coordination and data sharing while maintaining appropriate security boundaries.

Modern agentic AI implementations in financial services often involve multiple specialized agents working together: customer service agents, risk assessment agents, compliance agents, trading agents, and fraud detection agents. These agents may need to share information, coordinate decisions, or hand off tasks to each other. However, this interconnectedness creates opportunities for compromise propagation that don't exist in single-agent systems.

The fundamental challenge lies in balancing the operational need for agent coordination with the security requirement for proper isolation and trust boundary enforcement. When these boundaries are violated, a compromise in one low-risk agent can cascade to affect high-risk agents with greater privileges or more sensitive data access.

### Trust Boundary Violation Mechanisms

* **Agent-to-Agent Communication Compromise**
  Malicious agents inject harmful data, instructions, or corrupted state into communication channels with other agents, causing receiving agents to adopt compromised behaviors or decision-making patterns.

* **Shared Resource Contamination**
  Compromised agents corrupt shared databases, APIs, or state storage systems that other agents rely upon, causing systematic decision-making errors across multiple agent types.

* **Agent Authority Impersonation**
  Compromised agents impersonate higher-privilege agents or use stolen credentials to access resources or influence decisions outside their intended scope.  This is similar to a privilege escalation attack, where the risk is that agent privilege level needs to be clearly defined and enforced.

* **Cross-Agent Privilege Inheritance**
  Design flaws allow agents to inherit or assume privileges from other agents they interact with, leading to privilege escalation across the multi-agent system.  Where agent action-scope is not clearly defined and monitored this could lead to significant privilege escalation

* **Cascade Failure Propagation**
  Failures or compromises in one agent cause cascading failures in dependent agents, potentially bringing down entire business processes or decision-making chains.

### Financial Services Multi-Agent Scenarios

* **Customer Service to Risk Assessment Cascade**
  A compromised customer service agent provides manipulated customer information to risk assessment agents, causing systematic errors in credit decisions or investment recommendations.

* **Trading to Compliance Agent Influence**
  A compromised trading agent influences compliance agents to approve trades that violate risk limits or regulatory requirements by providing false market data or risk assessments.

* **Fraud Detection to Payment Processing**
  A compromised fraud detection agent provides false clearances to payment processing agents, allowing fraudulent transactions to proceed without proper scrutiny.

* **Document Processing to Decision Agents**
  Compromised document processing agents provide manipulated information to loan approval or investment advisory agents, leading to inappropriate financial decisions based on corrupted data.

* **Customer Verification to Account Management**
  A compromised customer verification agent provides false identity confirmations that enable account management agents to perform unauthorized actions on customer accounts.

### Attack Propagation Patterns

* **Horizontal Propagation**: Compromise spreads between agents of similar privilege levels through shared resources or communication channels.

* **Vertical Escalation**: Lower-privilege agents influence higher-privilege agents through data manipulation or communication channel abuse.

* **Hub-and-Spoke Attacks**: Central coordination agents are compromised to influence multiple peripheral agents simultaneously.

* **Chain Reaction Compromises**: Sequential agent compromises where each compromised agent enables the compromise of the next agent in the business process chain.

### Consequences

Multi-agent trust boundary violations can result in comprehensive system compromises:

* **Systemic Business Process Failure**: Entire business processes involving multiple agents may become compromised, affecting all transactions within those processes.
* **Cross-Functional Impact**: Compromise may affect multiple business functions (customer service, risk, compliance, trading) simultaneously.
* **Amplified Financial Loss**: Coordinated compromise across multiple agents can amplify financial losses beyond single-agent incidents.
* **Complex Incident Response**: Multi-agent compromises require coordinated incident response across multiple systems, increasing recovery complexity and cost.
* **Regulatory Scope Expansion**: Violations may affect multiple regulatory domains simultaneously, expanding compliance and legal consequences.
* **Trust Network Collapse**: Compromise of agent trust relationships may require rebuilding entire multi-agent coordination systems.

### Key Risk Factors

- **Insufficient Agent Isolation**: Lack of proper security boundaries between different agent types and privilege levels.
- **Weak Inter-Agent Authentication**: Poor authentication and authorization controls for agent-to-agent communications.
- **Shared Resource Security**: Inadequate security controls for databases, APIs, and other resources shared between multiple agents.
- **Cross-Agent State Management**: Poor isolation of agent state and memory systems allowing cross-contamination.
- **Agent Trust Model Flaws**: Fundamental design flaws in how agents establish and maintain trust relationships with each other.
- **Insufficient Monitoring**: Limited visibility into cross-agent interactions and communication patterns.
